Although it may have been accidental, the unfortunate advertising and branding of this product with the child can be taken from societal viewpoints as ignorant and racist. This general revolt would categorize the company H&amp;M as a company which does not care about how they speak about others. Those who are impacted by this event feel that the hoodie categorized the African child and thus all Africans into a depiction where it is okay to relate a human being to the title of a monkey purely based on skin color. The piece by Dr. Zevallos titled </span><span class="c5">What is Otherness?</span><span class="c2">, explains how the human mind separates what it believes to be normal and not normal based on their previous experiences and upbringings. Although the situation may not have been on purpose, the resulting reaction from society demonstrates how the concept of otherness applies to people who can actively use a piece of cloth to explain a racist motive.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c4 c7" id="h.dq7j4gjsi8x6"><span class="c3"></span></h1><h1 class="c4" id="h.1mgmw8jgjy40"><span class="c3">Post #3: Racist Messages at the United States Air Force Academy - NOV 17</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Colorado Springs, Colorado, messages were found upon the doors of five African American Air Force Academy Cadets studying at the preparatory school. The words &ldquo;Go Home&rdquo; which were scribbled on the doors of the cadets sparked an uproar at the campus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This example grew notorious due to the significant weight behind the victims and perpetrators. Although an act like this is important for all affected, the significance due to the fact that these cadets would soon lead nationals military can make many question the type of people that will grow to lead our nation&rsquo;s armed forces. In class, we had spoken about how the concept of otherness is demonstrated in the Angel Island Poems. Similar to how the immigrants were being treated due to their inclination to become citizens, cadets were treated with the same verbal abuse which took place on Angel Island. The cadets had wanted to become part of the United States Air Force just as how the immigrants had wanted to become citizens. This exemplifies otherness as depicted in the Angel Island poems because these cadets separated from their peers by the basis of their skin color. The were automatically categorized into the area of &ldquo;other&rdquo; just due to one cadet&rsquo;s generalizations about African Americans.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.knu8eehho74s"><span class="c3">Post #4: Immigration</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Asd</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.omfh0rcv6kig"><span class="c3">Post #5: Sexuality</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Asd</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.k2gbx6ar7v2o"><span class="c3">Post #6 Disability</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Asd</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.mqs3w9xury24"><span class="c3">Post #7 Senator Tammy Duckworth Cannot Take Maternity Leave as a Sitting Senator - 14 FEB 18</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has been a topic of controversy as she pushes for a understanding regarding senators&rsquo; rights and benefits while giving birth as an actively participating senator. This situation brings about a revelation because Senator Duckworth is the first woman to give birth while holding the position. Although the government gives her 12 weeks of paid family leave after giving birth, it prohibits her from acting as a functioning senator. She will be denied the option to vote or sponsor legislation. In essence, she will not be able to pick and choose when she can work, or work around her motherly duties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This is dilemma poses an important question for the American government as females begin to hold larger portions of congressional jobs. As stated, the current rules project the female to take the 12 weeks of family leave without the option to continue working. As stated in the newspaper, men who welcome a new child have the option of picking which days they can work. Furthermore, they can sponsor legislation and work while away from the Capitol. This embodies the idea of otherness, specifically that of gender issues in the modern society because of the difference in expectations between male and female senators. In the example given, the majority of senators are male and the rules are based off of the average male senator. Senator Duckworth is defined not in herself but in relation to her male counterparts. She has to fight to change the rules in her office just because of her biological sex and duties as a mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.dw42ipv1xi89"><span class="c3">Post #8 Facebook Breaches Trust and Privacy - 13 APR 18</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood before Congress to explain the actions and reasoning behind his company exposing millions of Facebook user&rsquo;s private information and data. While it was broadcasted on the television, it is noted that senators, representatives, and other cabinet members asked questions to better understand the severity of Facebook&rsquo;s act in the data breach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The actions and effects of this data breach raises the question of citizenship and Americanism in the United States. This data breach affected millions of people, especially millions of Americans. Now that they are being investigated to their part in the presidential election, society is wondering about their rights and protection from these corporate hegemons. The concept of otherness as described by Dr. Zevallos in her piece titled </span><span class="c5">What is Otherness?</span><span class="c2">, relates to the relationship between the corporation and user as it does between a government and citizen. The concept of citizenship is questioned here as the expected rights of the user were violated. From the perspectives of the corporation, the individual user is far too weak to fight its billion dollar-worth self. Therefore the corporation does not take special attention when dealing with users. This act purely shows the mentality of how Facebook considers its average user as unequal as they could not even have protected their data.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.xk3clqg5c9j3"><span class="c3">Post #9</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Asd</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.dx0ocyqdcamq"><span class="c3">Post #10</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">asd</span></p></body></html>
