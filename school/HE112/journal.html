These comments show the distaste towards the idea of Meghan Markle, an actress of African descent, marrying Prince Harry of the United Kingdom. The comments published by The Guardian show the conversation between her and a Facebook friend.<br><br>Marney&rsquo;s comments shown in the white text resemble the mentality of many people in modern society. This ignorant, elitist nature unfortunately exemplifies the furthering of the idea of otherness. Ask discussed in Dr. Zevallo&rsquo;s piece titled </span><span class="c1">What is Otherness?</span><span>, Marney classifies an equivalent human being as &ldquo;another&rdquo; just based on her ethnic background. This ethnocentric method of thought automatically classifies anyone who is not Marney&rsquo;s own, a pure British line of the throne as an &ldquo;other&rdquo;.<br><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 180.11px; height: 463.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 180.11px; height: 463.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 200.50px; height: 462.58px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 200.50px; height: 462.58px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.c7qynairytmn"><span class="c3">Post #2: H&amp;M Coolest Monkey in the Jungle - 13 JAN 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span><br>The clothing store H&amp;M introduced a childrens hoodie which had the words &ldquo;Coolest Monkey in the Jungle&rdquo; written on it. All branding and advertisements of that hoodie pictured a young ethnically African child wearing the hoodie. There has been much backlash to this as the term monkey is a derogatory term to describe those from Africa. <br><br>This example contains ideas that we have discussed in class such as that of otherness and the idea of distinguishing people into the &ldquo;other&rdquo; category. Although it may have been accidental, the unfortunate advertising and branding of this product with the child can be taken from societal viewpoints as ignorant and racist. This general revolt would categorize the company H&amp;M as a company which does not care about how they speak about others. Those who are impacted by this event feel that the hoodie categorized the African child and thus all Africans into a depiction where it is okay to relate a human being to the title of a monkey purely based on skin color. The piece by Dr. Zevallos titled </span><span class="c1">What is Otherness?</span><span>, explains how the human mind separates what it believes to be normal and not normal based on their previous experiences and upbringings. Although the situation may not have been on purpose, the resulting reaction from society demonstrates how the concept of otherness applies to people who can actively use a piece of cloth to explain a racist motive.<br><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 461.47px; height: 347.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 461.47px; height: 347.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.z8u5umo3ux2l"><span class="c3">Post #3: Racist Messages at the United States Air Force Academy - NOV 17</span></h1><p class="c8"><span><br>In Colorado Springs, Colorado, messages were found upon the doors of five African American Air Force Academy Cadets studying at the preparatory school. The words &ldquo;Go Home&rdquo; which were scribbled on the doors of the cadets sparked an uproar at the campus.<br><br>This example grew notorious due to the significant weight behind the victims and perpetrators. Although an act like this is important for all affected, the significance due to the fact that these cadets would soon lead nationals military can make many question the type of people that will grow to lead our nation&rsquo;s armed forces. In class, we had spoken about how the concept of otherness is demonstrated in the Angel Island Poems. Similar to how the immigrants were being treated due to their inclination to become citizens, cadets were treated with the same verbal abuse which took place on Angel Island. The cadets had wanted to become part of the United States Air Force just as how the immigrants had wanted to become citizens. This exemplifies otherness as depicted in the Angel Island poems because these cadets separated from their peers by the basis of their skin color. The were automatically categorized into the area of &ldquo;other&rdquo; just due to one cadet&rsquo;s generalizations about African Americans.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.m71prqsoibl0"><span class="c3">Post #4: SCOTUS denies DACA appeal - 26 FEB 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span><br>In an article written by Joseph P.

Similar to how the Chinese immigrants were being deported back to their homeland, young children who arrived in the United States under the impression of safety, success, and prosperity, are now being diverted back to their homelands. This striking similarity shows nearly no difference in the mercy shown between the government and immigrants who the government does not want in the country, The Angel Island Poems reflect the exact atmosphere that the modern day deportations contain.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.vtgtc0qlnjye"><span class="c3">Post #5: A Conversation About Sexuality - 13 MAR 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span><br>On March 13th, 2018, I was in San Francisco, California during spring break. While waiting in a line in town, my friend and I had overheard a conversation between an older couple. The gentleman had been talking about how their daughter had come out to them as lesbian and had earlier introduced her girlfriend to them. <br><br>While hearing the father express his initial surprise to his wife, the father had admitted that he was proud that their daughter had the courage to come speak to her parents. When I had heard this short conversation, I immediately thought of two references which were discussed in class. Alison Bechdel&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Fun Home</span><span>&nbsp;and Dr. Zevallo&rsquo;s piece </span><span class="c1">What is Otherness?</span><span>&nbsp;both relate to the atmosphere of the conversation that I had heard. For example, in </span><span class="c1">Fun Home</span><span>, Alison coming out to her parents had replicated the situation which I had overheard. She was able to confidently tell her parents that she was homosexual and that she had a girlfriend. I had thought of </span><span class="c1">What is Otherness?</span><span>&nbsp;because of the event in which her parents would not be welcoming to her newly disclosed lifestyle. She would not feel accepted by her very own parents, thus forcing her to believe that she is not welcome. This feeling of otherness would categorize her, a person, from her parents, also people, based on the stigmas which her parents held.<br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.69jtt4z7pc9n"><span class="c3">Post #6 Protests Around the Nation- 24 MAR 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span>I had taken this picture on March 24th, 2018 in Washington D.C. while viewing the March For Life that had swept through the Capitol.<br><br>Although unfortunate, the numerous shootings including the Las Vegas and Stoneman Douglas High School shooting have in result brought together millions of people who are fighting for one cause. I feel that this piece of popular culture is important in our lives as it connects to the piece titled &ldquo;Imagined Communities&rdquo; by Benedict Anderson. In his text, Anderson theorizes that these &ldquo;Imagined Communities&rdquo; contain numerous people who have never met each other, yet they share the same interests and core beliefs. In my picture, people are exercising their rights to protest by continuously voicing their opinions on issues that they deem important to our nation.<br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 403.82px; height: 204.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 403.82px; height: 204.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.9cpn7a2qc6cr"><span class="c3">Post #7 Senator Tammy Duckworth Cannot Take Maternity Leave as a Sitting Senator - 14 FEB 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span>Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has been a topic of controversy as she pushes for a understanding regarding senators&rsquo; rights and benefits while giving birth as an actively participating senator. This situation brings about a revelation because Senator Duckworth is the first woman to give birth while holding the position. Although the government gives her 12 weeks of paid family leave after giving birth, it prohibits her from acting as a functioning senator. She will be denied the option to vote or sponsor legislation. In essence, she will not be able to pick and choose when she can work, or work around her motherly duties.<br><br>This is dilemma poses an important question for the American government as females begin to hold larger portions of congressional jobs. As stated, the current rules project the female to take the 12 weeks of family leave without the option to continue working. As stated in the newspaper, men who welcome a new child have the option of picking which days they can work. Furthermore, they can sponsor legislation and work while away from the Capitol. This embodies the idea of otherness, specifically that of gender issues in the modern society because of the difference in expectations between male and female senators. In the example given, the majority of senators are male and the rules are based off of the average male senator. Senator Duckworth is defined not in herself but in relation to her male counterparts. She has to fight to change the rules in her office just because of her biological sex and duties as a mother.<br><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.88h9fbjxajc1"><span class="c3">Post #8 Facebook Breaches Trust and Privacy - 13 APR 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span>Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood before Congress to explain the actions and reasoning behind his company exposing millions of Facebook user&rsquo;s private information and data. While it was broadcasted on the television, it is noted that senators, representatives, and other cabinet members asked questions to better understand the severity of Facebook&rsquo;s act in the data breach.<br><br>The actions and effects of this data breach raises the question of citizenship and Americanism in the United States. This data breach affected millions of people, especially millions of Americans. Now that they are being investigated to their part in the presidential election, society is wondering about their rights and protection from these corporate hegemons. The concept of otherness as described by Dr. Zevallos in her piece titled </span><span class="c1">What is Otherness?</span><span>, relates to the relationship between the corporation and user as it does between a government and citizen. The concept of citizenship is questioned here as the expected rights of the user were violated. From the perspectives of the corporation, the individual user is far too weak to fight its billion dollar-worth self. Therefore the corporation does not take special attention when dealing with users. This act purely shows the mentality of how Facebook considers its average user as unequal as they could not even have protected their data.<br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.34edd43wuwpd"><span class="c3">Post #9 US Nationalism War Photography</span></h1><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 461.50px; height: 461.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 461.50px; height: 461.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span>This picture by photographer Gabriella Demczuk depicts the return of 18 African Americans returning to the Union after fighting in the United States Civil War. The story behind it explains how these 18 soldiers returned to form their own town which still exists today, Unionville, Maryland. This picture conveys a strong sense of American Nationalism as demonstrated in Irene Bloemraad&rsquo;s piece called </span><span class="c1">Being American/Becoming American: Birthright Citizenship and Immigrants&rsquo; Membership in the United States</span><span>. Bloemraad speaks of the characteristics which genuinely make someone &ldquo;American&rdquo;. As shown by the story of the 18 Unionville soldiers, they exhibited feelings of being a US National regarding their ethnicity, without the feeling of being an outsider.<br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.b6uei5hg9oqo"><span class="c3">Post #10 Drive to Mars 08 FEB 18</span></h1><p class="c8"><span class="c0">On February 8th, 2018, the American company SpaceX launched the most powerful active rocket on Earth to send a Tesla roadster, an electric car, on a trajectory to Mars.<br><br>This image brings about strong nationalistic references as it revitalizes the dream which President John F.
